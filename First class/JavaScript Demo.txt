
1) JavaScript :
	1) Core JavaScript
	2) Advanced JavaScript

2) JavaScript :
	Front End

3) Flight Example :
	Boarding :
		1) Checking baggage
		2) Immigration check
		3) Security check
		4) Boarding
		5) Take off

	Landing :
		1) Landing
		2) Immigration check
		3) Collect baggage
		4) Leave the airport

4) What is Programming :
	1) the set of instruction given to the computer is called Program
	2) Act of creating of program is called programming

5) Problem Solving :
		
	1) Input
		eg : carx -> 5, cary -> 6
	2) Process[computation]{Algorithm}:
	3) Output

	Solution :
	   Input :
		at_the_start = 100
		take_off = 40
		landing_planes = 60

	   Process(Solution):
		current_no_of_flights = at_the_start - take_off  + landing_planes 
			              = 100 - 40 + 60
				      = 120

           Output :
		display(current_no_of_flights)
	
		
6) Representation of Algorithm :
	1) Pseudo-code -> representation of algorithm in plain english
	2) Flow-chat -> representation of algorithm in diagramatic form.


7) Variable :
	Variable is nothing a container which stores a value and hold it
   = :
	Assignment Operator

8) Operators :
	1) Arithematic Operator
	2) Relational Operator
	3) Logical Operator

		1) Arithematic Operator :
			+	Add
			-	sub
			*	mul
			/	div
			%	modulus(remainder)

		2) Relational Operator :
			== 	Checking(Whether two values are equal or not)
			< 	less than
			> 	greater than
			<= 	less than or equal to
			>= 	gerater than or equal to

9)  Flow of Control :
		1) Selection sructures
		2) Repetitive structures

		1) Selection sructures(condition defining) :
			eg : if runway == "free":
				display("you can land")
			     else :
				display("you can circle in  the air")
